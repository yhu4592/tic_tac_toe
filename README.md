**Tic Tac Toe**

Tic tac toe game in Ruby.

This program is written in Ruby using a class. The program asks two users for their markers and the players will enter the position on the board for where they'd like to place their marker. The program will check winning conditions each time a marker is placed. When a winner is declared, the scores for the players will be modified. The game will end when a winner is declared or when the board is filled after nine turns. The players will then have the option to enter 'Y' or 'N' to start another game.
